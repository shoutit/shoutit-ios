     Address type of the geocoding result used for calculating directions.
     
     - StreetAddress:            Precise street address
     - Route:                    Named route (such as "US 101").
     - Intersection:             Major intersection, usually of two major roads.

     - Country:                  The national political entity, and is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder.
     - AdministrativeAreaLevel1: First-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
     - AdministrativeAreaLevel2: Second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
     - AdministrativeAreaLevel3: Third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
     - AdministrativeAreaLevel4: Fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
     - AdministrativeAreaLevel5: Fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
     - ColloquialArea:           Commonly-used alternative name for the entity.
     - Locality:                 Incorporated city or town political entity.
     - Ward:                     Specific type of Japanese locality, to facilitate distinction between multiple locality components within a Japanese address.
     - Sublocality:              First-order civil entity below a locality.
     - SublocalityLevel1:        First-order civil entity below a locality.
     - SublocalityLevel2:        Second-order civil entity below a locality.
     - SublocalityLevel3:        Third-order civil entity below a locality.
     - SublocalityLevel4:        Fourth-order civil entity below a locality.
     - SublocalityLevel5:        Fifth-order civil entity below a locality.
     - Neighborhood:             Named neighborhood
     - Premise:                  Named location, usually a building or collection of buildings with a common name
     - Subpremise:               First-order entity below a named location, usually a singular building within a collection of buildings with a common name
     - PostalCode:              Postal code as used to address postal mail within the country.
     - NaturalFeature:           Prominent natural feature.
     - Airport:                  Airport.
     - Park:                     Named park.
     - PointOfInterest:          Named point of interest. Typically, these "POI"s are prominent local entities that don't easily fit in another category, such as "Empire State Building" or "Statue of Liberty."
