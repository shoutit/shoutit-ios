/**
 RMPaperTrailLogger is a custom logger (for CocoaLumberjack) that directs log
 output to your account on papertrailapp.com. It can log using TCP and UDP. On
 OS X, TLS is supported on TCP Connections. Currently, on iOS TCP connections
 only Plain-Text is supported. The default is UDP (which is always unencrypted).
 The logs are sent in a syslog format using RMSyslogFormatter. If you are going
 to provide a custom formatter, make sure that it formats messages that meets
 the syslog spec.
